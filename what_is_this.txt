LS4: A PLTL-prover based on labelled superposition with partial model guidance.

LS4 [1] is a prover for Propositional Linear Temporal Logic (PLTL). On the logic side, it is based on the calculus LPSup [2]. However, instead of saturating the given clause set, it uses partial models to guide the inference process.

LS4 uses the Minisat 2.2 SAT-solver as its internal solving engine.
